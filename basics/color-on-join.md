## Random join color.

Automatically adding a random color to new members is incredibly easy! Just use the **/toggle join color** without specifying a color role. This will automatically select a random color role for every new member that joins your server!

The command **/toggle join color** can also be used to set a specific color role as well. Just provide the name or the number of the color to one of the arguments!
