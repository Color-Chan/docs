# Disable auto join Discord server

By default Patreon has the permission to join Discord servers for you. Sadly this is not a choice given to creators on Patreon.

## Connect your account

First you will need to go to [Connect apps ](https://www.patreon.com/settings/apps)on Patreon. Here you will need to Disconnect and reconnect your Discord account.

## Change the permission

Now comes the most important step. You will need to copy the URL in the browser, paste it in a different window and remove the highlighted yellow text.\
This will remove the Patreon's permission to join servers for you.
