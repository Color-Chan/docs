## Connecting your Discord account with Patreon.

First you need to connect your Patreon account with your Discord account so the bot knows you have a subscription. All you need to do is following the steps mentioned [here](https://support.patreon.com/hc/en-us/articles/212052266-How-do-I-get-my-Discord-Rewards-).

After you have followed those instructions you should be able to use **/patreon info** to see information about your subscription.

## Connecting your subscription to a server.

You can use the **/patreon connect** command to connect your subscription to a server.\
Just use the command in the server where you want to use it!

## Disconnecting your subscription from a server.

Simply use the **/patreon disconnect** command in the server where you want to disconnect your patreon from.

You can also provide the server ID of the server that you want to disconnect from by passing it to the **ID** argument, **/patreon disconnect id:403577303784882186** for example. This could be useful if you have a the server without removing your patreon subscription from it.\
You can find the ID by using the **/patreon info** command.
