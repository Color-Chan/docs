# Getting started / Setup

## 1. Add Color-Chan to your server.

You can invite Color-Chan with the following link: [https://colorchan.com/permalinks/invite](https://colorchan.com/permalinks/invite)

## 2. Move Color-Chans role.

Color-Chan creates the color roles **below her highest role**. You will need to drag Color-Chan above all the roles that do not have the Default color role, to avoid overlapping issues with colors from different roles.

## 3. Add color roles!

You can add a default color list with: **/add default colors**, or you can add a random color with **/add random color**. You can also add your own color with **/add rgb color** and **/add hex color** by providing a name and a color code. More information about color codes can be found [here](https://htmlcolorcodes.com/color-picker/). Examples on how to use the add color commands can be found on the **Adding colors** page.
