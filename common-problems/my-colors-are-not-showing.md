# My colors are not showing

Discord only shows the color of the role that a user has with the **highest** position. This means that the color roles need to be **above all normal roles**, or you will need the **give all the normal roles** (That have a higher position then the color roles) **the default color**.

### Option 1

Give all the roles above the color roles the default color.

Role order option 1.
{% endembed %}

### Option 2

Drag Color-Chan's role and the color roles above all other roles.
