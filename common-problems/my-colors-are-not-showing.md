# My colors are not showing

Discord only shows the color of the role that a user has with the **highest** position. This means that the color roles need to be **above all normal roles that** have a color assigned to them, or you will need the **give all the normal roles** (That have a higher position then the color roles) **the default color**. Please read [Role Management 101](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/214836687-Role-Management-101) for more information about role colors.

### Option 1

Give all the roles above the color roles the default color.

### Option 2

Place Color-Chan's role and the color roles above all other non-moderation roles. Don't forget to set the moderation roles to the default color as mentioned in [Option 1](my-colors-are-not-showing.md#option-1).

{% hint style="danger" %}
Never put your Mod and/or Admin roles below color roles. Because this will affect the moderation capabilities of your moderators and admin! Please read [Role Management 101](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/214836687-Role-Management-101) to get a better understanding of this issue
