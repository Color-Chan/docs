## Adding a random color.

You can also add random colors with the **/add random color** command. Or you can use the **/suggest color** if you want a suggestion on what colors you could add.

## Adding specific colors.

You can add specific colors with a color name and a HEX code or a RGB code. More information about color codes can be found [here](https://htmlcolorcodes.com/color-picker/).

You can also add existing color roles with the **/add existing color** command.\
**Example: /add existing color role:@Red**

## **Importing a color list from a different server.**

It is also possible to import an existing color list from a different server. You will need to get the export ID with **/export color list**. You can import the existing list with the following command after you have gotten the export ID: **/import color list id:123456**
