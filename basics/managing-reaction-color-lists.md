## Adding and creating color reaction lists.

You can create reaction color lists once you have added colors to color list!\
Simply use the **/add reaction colors** command to add all your colors to reaction lists.

You can also add specific colors to a reaction list. This can be done with the **/add reaction color** command. The only thing you will need to provide is the color name or the color number.\
Example: **/add reaction color name:Red**\
****Example: **/add reaction color number:1**

## Deleting reaction color lists.

Deleting a reaction color list is incredibly simple! **Just delete Color-Chan's message, this will automatically delete the reaction list.**

You can also delete it manually if the message has already been deleted.\
Just get the ID of the reaction list that you want to delete with **/reaction lists**.

Then use that ID with the **/delete reaction list**. \
Example: **/delete reaction list id:907028339548618793**
