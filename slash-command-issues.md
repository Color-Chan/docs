Please follow the steps bellow on none of the steps mentioned above worked.

### 3. Restart your Discord application.

Make sure to fully close Discord, don't leave it running it in the background. Otherwise this step will not work correctly.

### 4. Update your Discord application.

#### 4.1 Desktop

Fully close the app as mentioned in step **3**, then reopen Discord. Discord will automatically check for new updates when launching, so it will update if there is one available.

#### 4.2 Mobile (Android)

Go to the app store and search for **Discord**, and click the **update button** if there is one. If not, then your discord is already up to date.

#### 4.3 Mobile (IOS)

Go to the app store and lick on the **Updates** tab, and click the **update button** if there is one. If not, then your discord is already up to date.

### 5. Enable the slash commands window in your app.

Enable the **Use slash commands and preview emojis, mentions, and markdown syntax as you type** setting in your user settings. You can access this by clicking on the gear icon in the bottom left corner.
